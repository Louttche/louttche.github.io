### About this project

This project explored core concepts in image processing and computer vision using MATLAB. The focus was on practical applications such as image restoration, segmentation, and denoising.

### Key Features

- Implemented k-means clustering algorithms to segment images of apples by color.
- Enhanced images with low dynamic range or poor lighting conditions.
- Applied dehazing, deblurring, and denoising techniques using standard MATLAB functions.
- Evaluated and compared the effectiveness of different restoration and enhancement methods.

### Challenges

- Achieving accurate segmentation of apples with similar colors or overlapping regions.
- Restoring image quality in cases of severe noise or blur.
- Fine-tuning algorithm parameters for optimal results across diverse image sets.

### Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with MATLAB's image processing toolbox.
- Developed an understanding of clustering algorithms for image segmentation.
- Learned to apply and assess various restoration and enhancement techniques in real-world scenarios.
- Improved problem-solving skills in handling challenging image datasets.
