### About this project
This project was made in a group of 4 people for the ProCP course at Fontys Hogenscholen. <br>
The prototype was made to be used for risk assessment when planning construction while taking
into account what resources are needed and at what cost to prevent destructive fire emergencies.

### Key Features
- Map editor tool
- Import/Export maps
- Play/Pause simulation tools
- A* search algorithm
- Reports for each run per map
