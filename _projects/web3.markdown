### About this project

This project is part of an introductory university course focused on modern web development using Laravel. The module covers essential front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP) as well as Node.js for back-end development.

Throughout the course, we expored the current best practices in both front-end and back-end web development. Working in a group, we designed and implemented a complete web application using Laravel, applying the concepts learned in class. The project is completed over a seven-week period.

The development environment utilizes the XAMPP control panel to host a MySQL database, with phpMyAdmin used for database management.
