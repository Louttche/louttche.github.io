    <h1>Hi I'm Katerina, but most people call me Kathy.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer with a passion for building innovative, impactful, and sometimes...
        experimental solutions.

            I specialize in web development and data analysis, with an affiliation for embedded systems, which means
            you will mostly find me working on the backend of things - although it is always satisfying building
            something that provides good user experience.

            On the side, I enjoy installing or repairing hardware, gaming and playing music. I also like to try to stay
            active, either by hiking, playing tennis, or trying new sports.
