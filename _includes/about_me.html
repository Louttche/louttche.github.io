        <h1>Hi I'm Katerina,</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer with a passion for building innovative, impactful, and sometimes...
            experimental solutions.
        </p>

                I specialize in web development and data analysis, with an affiliation for embedded systems, which means
                you will mostly find me working on the backend of things - although it is always satisfying building
                something that provides good user experience.

                On the side, I enjoy installing or repairing hardware, gaming and playing music. I also try to stay
                active, either by working out, playing tennis or trying new sports.
